	<!-- Delnar: Holy balls was this a pain in the backside to edit without the tool that Firaxis obviously uses, and I don't even know if it works properly.
		 This is why I'm going to wait for the SDK before making major edits to behavior trees and their nodes.

		 Also, disclaimer, some of my explanations may not be correct, especially the odd list + decorator combo and the way concurrent nodes trigger.
		 This stuff will hopefully get cleared up once we have proper documentation and/or when we get our hands on the DLL source code...
		 ... or just after months' worth of trial and error. -->

		<!-- List proceeds as followed (each row corresponds to one node), list is modelled after Simple Operation Attack
		
		Tree runs until encounters FAILURE or RUNNING (standard for all trees)
		Pillage districts (improvements ignored, restriction in TreeData)
		Recruitment and retargeting sequence, basically lets the AI cycle through backups (child nodes) until it starts running one, then pick up where it left off when this is run again
		  Create a new value list  (check TreeData)
		  Label 1: Do the following until failure, then jump to Label 2
		    Decorate newly created value list as a list for unit recruitment values, name list "Recruitment Contracts"
				- Delnar: I don't know why this ^ here is under Label 1, it makes more sense to occur before the label, but Simple Operation Attack had it like this, so huh
		    Select eligible units (from the formation) using "Recruitment Contracts" as storage to carry out the next nodes' orders
		    Attack units that are along the way to target district, but only if at favorable odds (see TreeData)
		    Move towards target district
		  Label 2: Do the following until failure, then jump to Label 3
		    Change target to a new district
		    Select eligible units (from the formation) using "Recruitment Contracts" as storage to carry out the next nodes' orders
		    Attack units that are along the way to target district, but only if at favorable odds (see TreeData)
		    Move towards target district
		  Label 3: Do the following until failure, then end
		    Select eligible units (from the formation) using "Recruitment Contracts" as storage to carry out the next nodes' orders
		    Pillage anything nearby (restrictions lifted in TreeData)
