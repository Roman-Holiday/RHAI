RomanHoliday's AI Rework

This AI behaviour rework and enhancement makes the game and every leader significantly more challenging, unique and fun to play against (even more so relative to the vanilla AI in the mid to late game). Civ 6 is a fantastic game but the one thing holding it back is passive, mostly unambitious and predictable AI, especially in multiplayer games with friends. Here is the end product, enjoy and be warned, the AI will not play the way you expect ;)
